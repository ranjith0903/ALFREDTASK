# LeitnerLearn

LeitnerLearn is a **flashcard-based learning app** implementing the **Leitner System** using spaced repitition logic. This app helps users review and retain information efficiently by organizing flashcards into different review levels.

## 🎯 Thought Process & Implementation

### 🔧 Backend Implementation

- **Express + Mongoose + MongoDB Atlas** for efficient object modeling.
- **JWT authorization**
- **Leitner System Logic**:
 -Receives User Response

 -The API takes an id (flashcard ID) and correct (boolean) from the request body.
 correct: true → Answered correctly.
 correct: false → Answered incorrectly.
 Fetches the Flashcard from the Database

 -Uses Mongoose to find the flashcard by _id and userId.
 If the flashcard is not found, returns a 404 Not Found response.
I mplements Leitner System Logic

 -If answered correctly, the flashcard moves to the next box (up to Box 5).
 If answered incorrectly, the flashcard resets to Box 1.
 Calculates nextReview Date Based on Box Level

 -Spaced repetition intervals are used:
 Box 1 → Review in 1 day
 Box 2 → Review in 2 days
 Box 3 → Review in 4 days
 Box 4 → Review in 7 days
 Box 5 → Review in 14 days
 Saves the Updated Flashcard to the Database

-The updated flashcard with the new box level and nextReview date is saved.

-**Fetching due cards thought process**

  -The backend extracts the user ID from the request.
  
  -The database is queried using $lte (less than or equal to) to fetch all flashcards where nextReview date is today or earlier.

  -The server returns the due flashcards to the frontend.

  -If no flashcards are due, an empty array is sent, and the frontend displays "No cards to review today."

- **Due Flashcards API:** Fetches only the flashcards scheduled for today’s review.

**Frontend Implementation**

- Zustand for state management(lightweight & efficient).
- Framer Motion animations for smooth flashcard transitions.
- Tinder-like UI but with buttons instead of swipes for reviewing.
- Dark Mode Toggle 
- Responsive Design for mobile and desktop.
